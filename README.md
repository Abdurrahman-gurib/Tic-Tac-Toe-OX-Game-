## Project Overview
This project is an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe (OX Game) in C#. It provides a simple command-line interface for two players to enjoy the game.

## Features
- A 3x3 grid for the game.
- Turn-based gameplay for two players.
- Win condition checks to determine the winner.
- Draw detection.
- Interactive command-line interface.

## How to Play
1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Compile the C# code if needed (instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section).
3. Run the executable to start the game.
4. Players take turns to input the cell position where they want to place their symbol.
5. The game continues until a player wins or it's a draw.

## Game Rules
- Players must input the position of an empty cell (1-9).
- Players cannot overwrite their opponent's symbol.
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- The player assigned "X" typically starts.
